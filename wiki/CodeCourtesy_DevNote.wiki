=== Block Comment Format ===

Use `/*!` Doxygen trigger in the first column 
and close with ` *\` (the star in the same column as the trigger).
The ` * ` in subsequent lines is optional, 
but it is easier to keep it in QtCreator editor.
The block comment should touch the bottom of the entity that it relates to,
but a blank line below.
If it is a stand alone block comment it should have a blank line top and bottom.
{{{
/*! @file Logger.h LogLib Logger class definitions
 */
#include "LogLib.h"
class Logger
{
public:
    Logger(void);
...
}
/*! @class Logger
 * @brief Engine for Logging Facility
 * @ingroup LogLib
 *
 * Detailed description ...
 *
 */
}}}

=== Lineend Comment Format ===

...

=== Minimum ===

The following elements are considered to provide minimal Doxygen support:
 * `@file` for every .cpp and .h source code file
 * `@class` for every class with basic usage and including these tags
  * `@ingroup`
  * `@since` and `@date` for timeline important documentation
  * `@bug` as needed to document suspected bugs or point to a tracked issue
  * `@remark` as needed to document unique algorithms, explain special situations, or needed warnings
  * `@todo` functionality that needs to be completed, but is not documented by *DO log messages
